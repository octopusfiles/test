                <h3>History of Psychiatry</h3>

                <p>This section deals with the history of psychiatry in India. Until Independence, the history of Indian psychiatry was mainly the history of the mental hospitals. The earliest asylums were established in the late 18th century, fitfully expanded over the next century and a half, and were the first systematic attempts at providing mental health care in the region. This timeline was shared with most parts of the world, from the Americas to Africa and Australia. Soon after Independence, and quite fortuitously, the practice of psychiatry itself was transformed by developments in pharmacology and changes in social attitudes across the world. General hospital psychiatry came into its own around this time, and the importance of the mental hospitals then seems to recede into the background. The history of mental hospitals is often portrayed as being rather monochromatically dark. Some of these papers attempt to offer a different tint, and perhaps even an alternate point of view.

                <h3>History of Medicine</h3>

                <p>The histories of medicine and of psychiatry, are, not unsurprisingly, intertwined. This section includes some pieces on the history of medicine and some on the pandemic and its impact on mental health.</p>

                <h3>Partition</h3>

                <p>Sanjeev and Alok contributed to and co-edited <em>The Psychological Impact of the Partition of India</em>, published by Sage in 2018. The division of south Asia into separate nation states in 1947 was a partitioning of minds as much as it was a division of geography. The causes and consequences of the accompanying violence and trauma have not been fully examined in academic psychiatry. This silence has had an impact on our current understanding, wherein we pay relatively little attention to social trauma and distress, and the role these might play in mental (ill) health. We also, still, have a very fractured system for providing health care, especially mental health care.</p>

            <div class="desc law" style="display: none;">

                <h3>Law</h3>

                <p>Alok and Sanjeev were part of the group that developed the National Mental Health Policy, and also provided inputs into the Mental Health Care Act 2017. As we have long known, health programmes, policies, and legislations are organically intertwined and tend to influence each other. The writing of policy affects how societies think about mental health and the law, and vice versa. This section contains essays that specifically address questions of legality.</p>

            <div class="desc pol" style="display: none;">

                <h3>Policy</h3>

                <p>Both Alok and Sanjeev were members of the group that helped draft the National Mental Health Policy. This section includes some papers on the development of policy in India and related issues around mental health. It also includes some papers on psychiatric advance directives, ethics, and legal issues.</p>

            <div class="desc prac" style="display: none;">

                <h3>Practice</h3>

                <p>The practice of psychiatry is, as is the practice of any discipline in medicine, rather strictly regulated by existing legality. Legal frameworks themselves, however, are dynamic and influenced by conversations between society and state. As medical and psychiatric concepts evolve, often what influences these changes is as much societal as it is scientific. This ongoing process of change, and the fascinating interplay of these forces, is the subject of this section.</p>

Extraction of the active component, reserpine, and understanding its actions on synapses and circuitry lies at the root of modern treatments of schizophrenia, depression, and Parkinson's disease.

                        <blockquote>This special issue of the <em>International Review of Psychiatry</em> tries to describe the history of psychiatry in the Indian Ocean littoral region. Most accounts of the history of psychiatry have been confined to the Atlantic, and, in this issue, the growth of psychiatry in West and East Africa, India, Singapore, Indonesia, Australia, and New Zealand are put together. We discover obvious similarities with systems prevalent in the countries that once ruled these regions, but also similarities and differences between how they have negotiated the more recent past. This is important as the many places in the region have similar issues, and history, as always, teaches best by example.</blockquote>

                        <blockquote>Mesmerism flourished in Europe at the end of the 18th century, but had a contentious history. In its promise of a 'psychological influence' that could be shared across peoples, it was radically secular. James Esdaille established a Mesmeric Hospital in Sukea Street in Calcutta, but it was closed down soon after 1857. This hints at reasons why psychotherapy was abandoned for pharmacotherapy after 1857, and has never quite recovered.</blockquote>
